# RetroDOC5503
Retroshield setup: reverse-engineering the DOC 5503 

There is not a lot of documentation about the EnsoniQ 5503. Browsing through 6809 disassembly of the Ensoniq Mirage OS 3.2 is not enough to understand the full functionality of this device.
With the help of Erturk Kocalar (8bitforce.com) I went ahead and bit the bullet: we are using 8bitforce Retroshield with Erturk's experimental daughtercard to drive the DOC 5503 from Teensyduino (3.6 in this case).
